# Bug Fix: Sales Methodology Field Length

## Issue
**Error**: `failed to save profile`  
**Root Cause**: The `sales_methodology` column was defined as `VARCHAR(100)` but AI was returning descriptions longer than 100 characters.

**Example Error**:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (psycopg2.errors.StringDataRightTruncation) 
value too long for type character varying(100)
```

**AI-generated value**: "Consultative (relationship-led, solution-based approach focused on understanding client needs and delivering tailored management plans)" (133 characters)

## Solution

### 1. Database Migration
Created migration: `backend/migrations/fix_sales_methodology_length.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE tenants 
ALTER COLUMN sales_methodology TYPE TEXT;

COMMENT ON COLUMN tenants.sales_methodology IS 'Sales approach methodology (e.g., consultative, solution-based, value-based) - can include detailed description';
```

**Status**: ✅ Migration applied successfully

### 2. Model Update
Updated `backend/app/models/tenant.py`:

**Before**:
```python
sales_methodology = Column(String(100), nullable=True)
```

**After**:
```python
sales_methodology = Column(Text, nullable=True)  # e.g., "consultative", "solution-based" - can include detailed description
```

**Status**: ✅ Model updated, backend restarted

## Testing
- ✅ Database migration successful
- ✅ Backend restarted without errors
- ⏳ Ready for user to test profile saving

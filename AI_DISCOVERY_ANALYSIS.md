## Frontend Integration

### Discovery Detail Page

#### Run AI Analysis Button
- Located in "Quick Actions" section
- Primary blue button
- Shows "Analyzing..." during processing
- Automatically refreshes page after completion

#### AI Analysis Display
The analysis is displayed in a structured, professional format:

1. **Company Profile** - Comprehensive summary at the top
2. **Key Metrics Grid** - 2-column grid showing:
   - Business Sector
   - Company Size
   - Estimated Employees

### Contact Information Auto-Population

When AI analysis finds contact information, it automatically updates the lead record:
- **Contact Name**: Populated if found and field is empty
- **Contact Email**: Populated if found and field is empty
- **Contact Phone**: Populated if found and field is empty

**Note**: AI only updates empty fields to preserve manually entered data.

## Database Schema

### Lead Model Updates
The `ai_analysis` field stores the complete JSON response:

```python
class Lead(Base):
    # ... other fields ...
    ai_analysis = Column(JSON, nullable=True)  # Stores full AI analysis
    contact_name = Column(String(200), nullable=True)  # Auto-populated by AI
    contact_email = Column(String(255), nullable=True)  # Auto-populated by AI
    contact_phone = Column(String(50), nullable=True)  # Auto-populated by AI
```

## Usage Workflow

### For Users
1. Navigate to Discoveries page (`/leads`)
2. Click on a discovery to view details
3. Click "Run AI Analysis" button
4. Confirm the action
5. Wait for analysis (typically 10-30 seconds)
6. View comprehensive business intelligence
7. Contact information automatically populated if found

### For Developers

#### Backend Service
```python
from app.services.lead_generation_service import LeadGenerationService

service = LeadGenerationService(db, tenant_id)
result = await service.analyze_lead_with_ai(lead_id)

if result['success']:
    analysis = result['analysis']
    # Analysis data available
    # Contact info auto-saved to lead record
```

#### Frontend API Call
```typescript
import { campaignAPI } from '../services/api';

const handleRunAIAnalysis = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await campaignAPI.analyzeLead(leadId);
    if (response.data?.success) {
      // Reload lead to get updated data
      loadLead();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
};
```

## Performance Considerations

### Token Usage
- **Average**: 15,000-20,000 tokens per analysis
- **Cost**: ~$0.10-0.15 per analysis (GPT-5-mini pricing)
- **Time**: 10-30 seconds depending on data complexity

### Optimization
- Analysis results are cached in the `ai_analysis` field
- Re-running analysis on the same lead overwrites previous results
- Only updates empty contact fields (preserves manual data)

### Rate Limiting
- OpenAI API rate limits apply
- Recommend: Max 10 concurrent analyses
- Consider queuing for bulk analysis operations

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

1. **"OpenAI client not initialized"**
   - Cause: API key not configured
   - Solution: Add OpenAI API key in Settings

2. **"Lead not found"**
   - Cause: Invalid lead ID
   - Solution: Verify lead exists and user has access

3. **"Failed to parse AI response"**
   - Cause: AI returned invalid JSON
   - Solution: Retry analysis (rare occurrence)

4. **Timeout Errors**
   - Cause: Analysis taking >240 seconds
   - Solution: Retry or check API connectivity

### Logging
All analysis operations are logged with prefixes:
- `[AI ANALYSIS]` - General operations
- `[AI ANALYSIS] ‚úì` - Success messages
- `[AI ANALYSIS] ‚úó` - Error messages

Example logs:
```
[AI ANALYSIS] Running analysis for Quatrix Limited
[AI ANALYSIS] ‚úì Found contact name: Steven David Wheat (Director)
[AI ANALYSIS] ‚úì Found contact email: hello@quatrix.co.uk
[AI ANALYSIS] ‚úì Analysis completed for Quatrix Limited
```

## Best Practices

### When to Run AI Analysis

**‚úÖ Good Times:**
- After campaign generates new discoveries
- Before converting discovery to CRM lead
- When contact information is missing
- When assessing lead quality/priority

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- Running multiple times on same lead (wastes tokens)
- Running on leads with complete manual data
- Bulk analysis without rate limiting

### Data Quality

**To Get Best Results:**
1. Ensure external data is collected first (Google Maps, Companies House)
2. Verify website URL is correct
3. Run analysis after all API data is gathered
4. Review and validate AI-suggested contact information

### Contact Information Validation

**Important Notes:**
- AI-extracted contacts are suggestions, not guaranteed accurate
- Always verify contact information before use
- Check email format and phone number validity
- Consider manual verification for high-value leads

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Bulk Analysis** - Analyze multiple discoveries at once
2. **Analysis Scheduling** - Auto-analyze new discoveries
3. **Confidence Scores** - Rate reliability of extracted data
4. **Contact Verification** - Validate email addresses
5. **Historical Tracking** - Track analysis changes over time
6. **Custom Prompts** - Tenant-specific analysis criteria

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Email Verification API** - Validate extracted emails
2. **Phone Validation** - Verify UK phone numbers
3. **LinkedIn API** - Enhanced contact discovery
4. **CRM Enrichment** - Auto-update customer records

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- All data sent to OpenAI is encrypted in transit
- No PII stored in AI analysis results beyond what's publicly available
- Contact information sourced from public business listings
- Complies with GDPR for business contact data

### API Key Security
- OpenAI API keys stored encrypted in database
- Tenant-specific keys supported
- System-wide fallback keys available
- Keys never exposed in frontend

## Troubleshooting

### Analysis Not Running
1. Check OpenAI API key is configured
2. Verify API key has sufficient credits
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Ensure lead has sufficient data

### Poor Quality Results
1. Verify external data was collected
2. Check website URL is accessible
3. Ensure company has online presence
4. Try re-running after updating lead data

### Contact Information Not Found
- Not all companies have publicly available contacts
- AI can only find what's in the provided data
- Consider manual research for high-priority leads
- Check company website directly

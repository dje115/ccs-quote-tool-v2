## 📦 Version 2.2.1 - AI Suggestion Review & Merge System

### 🎯 Major Feature: AI Suggestion Review System

This release introduces a **complete overhaul** of the AI Auto-Fill workflow, providing users with full transparency and control over AI-suggested data.

### ✨ Key Features Implemented

#### 1. **Side-by-Side Data Comparison**
- Visual comparison showing **Current Data** vs **AI Suggested** data
- Color-coded sections for easy differentiation
- Clear labeling with "CURRENT" and "AI SUGGESTED" tags
- Count badges for array fields (e.g., "Products & Services (5)" vs "(8)")

#### 2. **Section-by-Section Control**
Individual action buttons for each field:
- **📝 Company Description**: "Use AI Version" | "Keep Current"
- **📦 Products & Services**: "Replace" | "Merge (Add New)" | "Keep Current"
- **⭐ Unique Selling Points**: "Replace" | "Merge (Add New)" | "Keep Current"
- **🎯 Target Markets**: "Replace" | "Merge (Add New)" | "Keep Current"
- **💼 Elevator Pitch**: "Use AI Version" | "Keep Current"

#### 3. **Global Quick Actions**
Bulk operations at the top of the review panel:
- **Replace All**: Apply all AI suggestions, overwriting current data
- **Merge All**: Combine AI suggestions with existing data (no duplicates)
- **Discard All**: Ignore all AI suggestions and close panel

#### 4. **Smart Merge Logic**
- **Arrays**: Combines both arrays and removes duplicates using Set
- **Objects**: Merges objects with AI values taking precedence
- **Strings**: Replace mode (merge doesn't make sense for text)

#### 5. **No Auto-Apply**
- AI suggestions are **never automatically applied**
- All data stored in separate `autoFillResults` state
- User must explicitly choose to apply changes
- Changes only persist when "Save Company Profile" is clicked

### 🎨 Visual Design

#### Color Scheme
- **Current Data**: Light gray (#f5f5f5)
- **Company Description**: Light blue (#e3f2fd)
- **Products & Services**: Light blue (#e3f2fd)
- **Unique Selling Points**: Light green (#e8f5e9)
- **Target Markets**: Light purple (#f3e5f5)
- **Elevator Pitch**: Light red (#ffebee)

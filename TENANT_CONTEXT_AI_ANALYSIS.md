# Tenant-Contextualized AI Analysis

## Overview
The AI Discovery Analysis system now includes **tenant company profile information** in the analysis prompt. This makes the business intelligence highly targeted and actionable by considering **how YOUR company's offerings align with the prospect's needs**.

## What Gets Included

When analyzing a discovery, the AI receives information about **YOUR company**:

- **Value Proposition**: Your elevator pitch

## How It Works

cloud backup for their financial data, and cybersecurity for PCI compliance - all of 
which align with our Managed Service Provider offerings."
